# Segmentation-Model
Semantic segmentation is a deep learning algorithm that associates a label or category with every pixel in an image. It is used to recognize a collection of pixels that form distinct categories. For example, an autonomous vehicle needs to identify vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, pavement, and other road features.
